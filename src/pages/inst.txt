This folder contains all the page components used in the application, 
where each file corresponds to a specific route.

Structure Guideline:
1. Each route in the app should have its own dedicated file inside this folder.
2. The file name should reflect the route name for easy understanding.
3. Use React functional components, preferably with named exports.
4. Keep page-specific logic (e.g., local state, API calls) inside these components.

What not to include
1. Don’t include shared components (like buttons, cards, modals) here. 
   Instead, place those in a components/ folder.
2. Don’t use this folder for layout or utility logic.
